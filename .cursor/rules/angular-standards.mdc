# Angular + SCSS Project Rules

## Component Structure
- Use standalone components by default (Angular 14+)
- Follow the single responsibility principle: one component per file
- Name components with `.component.ts` suffix
- Keep component files in dedicated folders with all related files

## TypeScript Standards
- Use strict mode (`strict: true` in tsconfig.json)
- Always define types for component properties and method parameters
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for object shapes
- Use `readonly` for properties that shouldn't change after initialization

## SCSS Best Practices
- Use SCSS variables for colors, spacing, and breakpoints
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3-4 levels)
- Scope styles to components (`:host` selector)
- Use BEM naming convention for CSS classes when needed
- Store global variables in `styles/variables.scss`

## Angular Patterns
- Use OnPush change detection strategy where possible
- Unsubscribe from observables (use `takeUntilDestroyed()` or `async` pipe)
- Prefer reactive forms over template-driven forms
- Use dependency injection for services
- Keep business logic in services, not components

## File Naming
- Components: `feature-name.component.ts`
- Services: `feature-name.service.ts`
- Modules: `feature-name.module.ts`
- Models/Interfaces: `feature-name.model.ts`
- Use kebab-case for all file names

## Code Organization
- Group related features in feature modules
- Use lazy loading for feature modules
- Keep shared components in a shared module
- Store models/interfaces in dedicated files
